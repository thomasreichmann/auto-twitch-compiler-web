# Auto Twitch compiler

This is the front-end of a web-app made to allow you to setup YouTube channels that automatically
compile clips from Twitch categories and upload the finished compilation to YouTube.

## Rewrite

Currently this branch is a rewrite of the whole application to port it over to next.js (from CRA),
and host it on Vercel (from firebase), while also completely detaching from firebase by using mongodb's Atlas as the database

---

The rewrite will both happen on this repo (front-end) and on the back-end repo more info on the back-end rewrite can be found there.

## Dev
